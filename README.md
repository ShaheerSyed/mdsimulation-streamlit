## Molecular Dynamics Simulation App
This application, developed by Shaheer Syed for CHEM 303 with Dr. Miles, enables users to explore Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. MD is a computer simulation method that studies the dynamic evolution of atoms and molecules. In this virtual realm, particle trajectories are determined by solving Newton's equations of motion, with forces and potential energies often calculated using molecular mechanics force fields.
